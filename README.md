For calculation of degree of anisotropy using Equation (1) https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b01827
Takes input as csv file with X, Y, DY columns
Has code for calculation of Hermanns orientation parameters, but hasn't been extensively tested with real data. Inputs with theoretical max alignments seem to be ok. The orientation direction is set to horizontal, max alignment along 3 oclock and 9 oclock.
